*** Public License for Software with Caveats ***

Each file in the Code Bank contains a program crafted for one or more research projects. Aside from fulfilling its primary objectives, the software is designed to illuminate the crucial concepts while abiding by the precepts of simplicity and clarity.

Given these goals, little or no effort has been made to implement ancillary features such as the breadth of functionality or resilience under stress. An example in this vein involves safeguards against improper usage. For instance, a particular program may access an external dataset under the premise that the records conform to a preset format. In that case, a faulty entry within the input file could derail the program and yield wayward results.

In short, each program in the repository is a research prototype meant to fulfill a pointed objective. A case in point is the demonstration of a specific capability and/or the attainment of a computational result. Put another way, the software is not a full-fledged product suitable for deployment in extraneous environments.
